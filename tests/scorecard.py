"""Print your CT 10: Iterators & Doubly Linked Lists score.

    python3 tests/scorecard.py

Run it from the top of your repository -- the folder that holds CMakeLists.txt,
not from inside tests/. It builds if it needs to, runs the Google Test suite,
and prints a scored breakdown that matches what the GitHub autograder will
award when the grader is run.

Points are per test, exactly as .github/workflows/classroom.yml awards them.
The "n of m" column shows how many tests in a section pass; unlike CT 01 there
is partial credit inside a section, because each test is graded on its own.

The identity in the header is taken from the repository, never typed in: the
git remote carries the GitHub username the Repo Creator assigned you, and
user.name / user.email are the identity stamped on your commits.
